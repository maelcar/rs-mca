# (L5) No large high-energy Boolean fiber — `prop:no-high-energy` skeleton

Stdlib-only (no mathlib) formalization of the **inequality composition** behind
`prop:no-high-energy` (L228–234) of `experimental/asymptotic_rs_mca.tex`, with the
two external additive-combinatorics inputs entering as **hypotheses**, never
baked into the logic (they are deep theorems whose proofs are out of scope; the
paper cites them, and a faithful skeleton must not silently assume them):

* `thm:bsg` Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers (L214–216): from a high-energy set one extracts
  a subset `A'` with `|A'| ≥ K^{-C}|A|` and `|A'-A'| ≤ K^C|A'|`.
* `thm:quasicube` (L220–226): every finite `A ⊆ {0,1}^N` has `|A-A| ≥ |A|^{3/2}`.
  To stay over `Nat` and avoid square roots, the squared form `|A|^4 ≤ |A-A|^2·|A|`
  is used (equivalent to `|A-A| ≥ |A|^{3/2}`).

Paper proof (L232–234): BSG gives `A' ⊆ A` with `|A'| ≥ e^{cN-o(N)}` and
`|A'-A'| ≤ e^{o(N)}|A'|`; quasicube gives `|A'-A'| ≥ |A'|^{3/2}`, so
`|A'|^{1/2} ≤ e^{o(N)}`, contradicting `|A'| ≥ e^{cN-o(N)}`.

The `e^{o(N)}` bookkeeping (`K^{±C} = e^{±o(N)}`) is the reals part and stays in
the tex.  The scale-free content is the **exact inequality composition**:
combining the BSG size/difference bounds with the (squared) quasicube bound forces

    `|A| ≤ K^{3C}`,

and hence, whenever the energy regime makes `K^{3C} < |A|` (the tex's
`|A| ≥ e^{cN-o(N)}` beating the subexponential `K^{3C} = e^{o(N)}`), a
contradiction.  Cardinalities are modelled directly as `Nat`; the Boolean-cube
membership needed to invoke quasicube is carried by the abstract predicate
`BoolFiber` (below), so the quasicube hypothesis reads exactly as
"every Boolean-cube fiber obeys the squared quasicube bound".

Kernel-checked, stdlib-only, no mathlib.

/-- `BoolFiber s d` abstracts "there is a set `A ⊆ {0,1}^N` with `|A| = s` and
`|A - A| = d`".  It is the interface through which the quasicube theorem is
applied; keeping it abstract means the difference-set cardinality `d` is a genuine
parameter, and the quasicube input is a hypothesis about *every* such fiber. -/

  intro ::

/-- **(L5) `prop:no-high-energy`, exact-inequality skeleton.**  Given

* `quasicube` — the quasicube theorem, as a hypothesis: every Boolean-cube fiber
  `(s, d)` satisfies the squared growth bound `s^4 ≤ d^2 · s`
  (i.e. `|A-A| ≥ |A|^{3/2}`);
* `bsg` — the BSG output, as a hypothesis: the high-energy set of size `f` yields a
  Boolean-cube subfiber `(s, d)` with `f ≤ K^C · s` (size bound, `|A'| ≥ K^{-C}|A|`)
  and `d ≤ K^C · s` (difference bound, `|A'-A'| ≤ K^C|A'|`),

the composition forces `f ≤ K^{3C}`. -/
